To get started, set your HF_API_TOKEN environment variable.

Next, change a few of the prompts in prompts.txt and edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest init --example huggingface-similarity
# or simply
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
