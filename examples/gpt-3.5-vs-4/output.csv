"Yes, you should switch. This is known as the Monty Hall problem, and the optimal strategy is to always switch. The reason for this is that when you initially chose a door, there was a 1/3 chance that you chose the car and a 2/3 chance that you chose a goat. When Monty reveals one of the goats, he is essentially giving you new information that the car is behind one of the other doors. Therefore, by switching, you increase your chances of getting the car from 1/3 to 2/3.","Yes, you should switch. This is known as the Monty Hall problem. When you initially choose a door, there is a 1/3 chance that you have picked the car and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors. When Monty reveals a goat behind one of the other doors, the probability of the car being behind the remaining door is still 2/3, while the probability of the car being behind your initial choice remains 1/3. So, switching doors increases your chances of winning the car.","1. Take the duck across first and leave it on the other side.
2. Go back and get the grain and take it across, but bring the duck back with you.
3. Leave the duck on the original side and take the fox across.
4. Leave the fox on the other side with the grain and take the duck back with you.
5. Finally, take the duck across one last time to join the others on the other side.","1. Take the duck across the river first and leave it on the other side.
2. Go back and take the grain across the river.
3. When you leave the grain on the other side, take the duck back with you to the original side.
4. Now, take the fox across the river and leave it with the grain.
5. Finally, go back one last time to pick up the duck and bring it across the river.

This way, you ensure that the duck and the grain are never left alone, and neither are the fox and the duck.",Cows drink water.,Cows drink water.,"As an AI language model, I do not have a specific year as I am not bound by time.

The court in State B would not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the divorce case if the wife did not establish a domicile in that state. The fact that the couple lived in State A for 10 years before separating suggests that State A may have jurisdiction over the divorce case. The husband's appearance in the case does not waive the jurisdictional challenge.","C. Yes, because state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over this type of action."
