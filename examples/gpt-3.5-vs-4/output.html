          years before separating. One month later, the wife permanently moved to State B and
          immediately filed for divorce in a federal court in State B. The wife claims that she is
          entitled to $300,000 in alimony. The husband appeared in the action and has filed a motion
          to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the court grant the motion? A.
          No, because the court has diversity jurisdiction over the case. B. No, because the husband
          waived a subject-matter jurisdiction challenge by appearing in the case. C. Yes, because
          state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over this type of action. D. Yes, because the
          wife did not establish a domicile in State B.

            Yes, you should switch. This is known as the Monty Hall problem, and the optimal
            strategy is to always switch. By switching, you increase your chances of getting the car
            from 1/3 to 2/3. This may seem counterintuitive, but it has been mathematically proven.

            Yes, you should switch. This is known as the Monty Hall problem. When you initially
            choose a door, there is a 1/3 chance that you have picked the car and a 2/3 chance that
            the car is behind one of the other two doors. When Monty reveals a goat behind one of
            the other doors, the probability of the car being behind the remaining door is still
            2/3, while the probability of the car being behind your initial choice remains 1/3. So,
            switching doors increases your chances of winning the car.

            1. Take the duck across first and leave it on the other side. 2. Go back and get the
            grain and take it across, but bring the duck back with you. 3. Leave the duck on the
            original side and take the fox across. 4. Leave the fox on the other side with the grain
            and take the duck back with you. 5. Finally, take the duck across one last time to join
            the others on the other side.

            1. Take the duck across the river first and leave it on the other side. 2. Go back and
            get the grain, taking it across the river. 3. When you leave the grain on the other
            side, take the duck back with you to the original side. 4. Now, take the fox across the
            river and leave it with the grain. 5. Finally, go back one last time to get the duck and
            bring it across the river. This way, you ensure that the duck and the grain are never
            left alone, and neither are the fox and the duck.

            D. Yes, because the wife did not establish a domicile in State B. The court in State B
            would not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the divorce case if the wife did not
            establish a domicile in that state. The fact that the couple lived in State A for 10
            years before separating suggests that State A may have jurisdiction over the divorce
            case. The husband&#39;s appearance in the case does not waive the jurisdictional
            challenge.
