To get started, set your HF_API_TOKEN environment variable. See also https://promptfoo.dev/docs/providers/huggingface/ for setup details.

Next, edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest init --example huggingface-inference-endpoint
# or simply
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
