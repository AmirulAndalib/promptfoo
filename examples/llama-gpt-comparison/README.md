To get started, set your OPENAI_API_KEY and REPLICATE_API_TOKEN environment variables.

Next, change a few of the prompts in prompts.txt and edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest init --example llama-gpt-comparison
# or simply
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
