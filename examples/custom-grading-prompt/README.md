To get started, set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

Next, have a look at the custom prompt in promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest init --example custom-grading-prompt
# or simply
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
