To get started, set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, or other required keys for the providers you selected.

Next, edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```bash
npx promptfoo@latest init --example tau-simulated-user
# or simply
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
